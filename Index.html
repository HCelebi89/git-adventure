    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
        <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
            <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to</p>
        <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
            <p>Branches give you the freedom to independently work on different modules (not necessarily though) and merge the modules when you finish developing them. It might sound a cumbersome process, but git branches are swift to be created and destroyed.</p>
        <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
            <p>The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on. You can think of a working tree as a file system where you can view and modify files. The index, or staging area, is where commits are prepared. The index compares the files in the working tree to the files in the repo.</p>
        <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
            <p>an area in which participants in a new especially military operation or mission are assembled and readied.</p>
        <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
            <p>$ git pull
                ….
                M   selenium/ant/build.properties
                ….
                M   selenium/scripts/linux/get_latest_updates.sh
                M   selenium/scripts/windows/start-selenium.bat
                Pull is not possible because you have unmerged files.
                Please, fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>' as appropriate to mark resolution, or use 'git commit -a'.</p>
